# Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection_Project
Project Overview: Credit card fraud is a growing concern for the banking and financial sector. Traditional methods for detecting fraud rely heavily on predefined rules and can be time-consuming and prone to errors. In this project, we will use machine learning techniques to detect fraudulent transactions in a credit card dataset. This will involve data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, training, evaluation, and deployment.
